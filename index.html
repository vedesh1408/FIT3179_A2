                    unique happiness landscape. But what's the Dystopia Residual, you ask? It's a whimsical measure that helps us understand how far each region's 
                    happiness level deviates from the hypothetical 'dystopia,' adding an intriguing layer to the story of global well-being.

                This whimsical metric measures how far a region's happiness level stands from a make-believe state of ultimate unhappiness, known as 'dystopia.' It's like 
                gauging the gap between a place's real joy and the absolute pits of despair. The bigger the gap, the happier the region is, making it a unique and playful 
                way to understand regional happiness. So, when you see a high Dystopia Residual, it means that region is a long way from the land of gloom, and happiness reigns 
                supreme!
